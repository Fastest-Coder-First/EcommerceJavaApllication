# Inventory Management System for E-commerce Platform

This project was developed as part of a team-driven hackathon, organized by Microsoft, with the aim of creating an Inventory Management System for an e-commerce platform. The project utilized the power of GitHub Copilot, an AI-driven code completion tool, to enhance the development process and streamline collaboration among team members. This README file provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and the impact of GitHub Copilot on the development and submission process.

## Project Overview

The Inventory Management System is designed to facilitate efficient management of products, ensuring accurate stock tracking and seamless product updates. The system incorporates the following functionalities:

1. Adding Products: Allows users to add new products to the inventory, providing necessary details such as product name, price, and quantity. GitHub Copilot was instrumental in generating code snippets for input validation and error handling during the implementation of this feature.

2. Updating Products: Enables users to modify product information, such as price or quantity, ensuring real-time updates to the inventory. GitHub Copilot provided code suggestions for retrieving and updating product attributes, expediting the development process.

3. Removing Products: Allows users to remove products from the inventory, ensuring accurate tracking of available products. GitHub Copilot's code suggestions simplified the implementation of the product removal functionality, eliminating repetitive coding tasks.

4. Checking Available Stock: Provides users with the ability to check the availability of a specific product in the inventory. GitHub Copilot assisted in generating code snippets for retrieving product information and displaying stock availability, contributing to the reliability of this feature.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

GitHub Copilot played a significant role in enhancing the development process and streamlining collaboration among team members. Its intelligent code suggestions provided valuable insights and optimized coding efforts in the following ways:

- *Code Quality Improvement:* GitHub Copilot's contextual code suggestions ensured adherence to best practices, coding conventions, and error handling, resulting in cleaner and more robust code.

- *Accelerated Development:* By providing accurate code completions and relevant function signatures, GitHub Copilot accelerated the coding process, allowing team members to focus on core functionality implementation.

- *Reduction of Repetitive Tasks:* GitHub Copilot generated code snippets for common operations, such as data retrieval, updating, and removal, reducing the need for writing boilerplate code and enhancing code efficiency.

- *Improved Collaboration and Code Review:* GitHub Copilot's adherence to coding conventions and best practices enhanced collaboration among team members, facilitating efficient code reviews and ensuring a high-quality codebase.
